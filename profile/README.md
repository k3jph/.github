# Eur Ing Dr James P. Howard, II

A Mathematician, a Different Kind of Mathematician, and a Statistician

## About me

I am a data scientist at the  [Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory](http://www.jhuapl.edu/). Previously, I have been a consultant to various government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Executive Office of the President, and the United States Department of Homeland Security. Before that, I served as an internal consultant on scientific computing for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Alongside my professional work, I have a strong passion for teaching and have been teaching mathematics and statistics at the University of Maryland Global Campus since 2010. I have also taught public affairs at several institutions, including the City University of New York and the  [University of New Mexico](https://jphoward.people.unm.edu/).

I consider myself  [fortunate to have played a part in many innovative projects throughout my career](https://jameshoward.us/scholarship), which include modeling the spread of infectious respiratory diseases and Ebolavirus, predicting global disruptive events, researching blockchain for government services, and designing devices to rescue victims of building collapse. I have also authored  [two books](https://jameshoward.us/books/)  on my work and co-edited two more.

In my free time, I’m an active member of my community, having served  [Howard County, Maryland](https://jameshoward.us/service/howard-county)  in various roles including as a member of the Board of Appeals and Charter Review Commission. I’ve also volunteered my time providing economic advice to the  [Columbia Association](http://www.columbiaassociation.com/), establishing an alumni association for the  [College Park Scholars Program](https://www.scholars.umd.edu/)  at the University of Maryland, and serving on several public and private boards.
